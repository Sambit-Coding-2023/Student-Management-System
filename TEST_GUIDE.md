# Authentication System Test Guide

## Quick Test Steps

1. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3000

2. **Test Registration**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/register
   - Fill out the registration form with valid data
   - Submit the form
   - Check browser console for debugging messages
   - Should automatically redirect to dashboard after successful registration

3. **Test Login**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use the credentials from your registration
   - Submit the form
   - Should automatically redirect to dashboard after successful login

4. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Try accessing http://localhost:3000/dashboard directly
   - If not logged in, should redirect to login page
   - If logged in, should show the dashboard

## Debugging

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open browser developer tools and look for console messages
2. **Check Network Tab**: See if API calls to the backend are successful
3. **Check Local Storage**: Verify that the token is being stored correctly

## Backend Verification

The backend is working correctly as verified by our tests. The API endpoints are:
- POST /api/auth/register - Working ✅
- POST /api/auth/login - Working ✅  
- GET /api/auth/me - Working ✅

## Common Issues Fixed

1. **Routing Issues**: Fixed the App.js routing structure
2. **State Management**: Enhanced AuthContext with better debugging
3. **Navigation**: Added manual redirect as fallback
4. **Loading States**: Improved loading state handling

The system should now work correctly for registration and login.
